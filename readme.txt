 This directory contains the source code and data files from the
 book.  See the README.code file for the licensing statement and
 Disclaimer of Warranty.  See the README.data file for a short
 description of the data files.

 The source code is written in C and has been tested on ANSI C
 compilers on an IBM RS/6000 workstation, a Silicon Graphics
 workstation, and a Sun SPARCstation.  The software has not been
 tested on any PCs.  We see no reason why it should not run on a
 PC, but the user may have to make some modifications, especially
 if the data types do not agree with those of the workstations
 (e.g., 2-byte int's).  See Appendix A in the book for comments
 on porting.

 For instructions on compiling and running the source code, refer
 to Appendix A of the book.
