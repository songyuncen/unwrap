   These are the datasets used for the experiments in the book.
   For detailed information regarding these data, we refer the
   user to chapter 3.
   
   The file naming convention is as follows:
            name.NNNxNNN.ext
   where "name" is the dataset name (e.g., head), "NNNxNNN" is
   the file dimension (e.g., 256x256), and "ext" is the file
   extension (e.g., phase).
   
   All files are in simple "raster" format, and the dimensions
   are part of the file name.  For example, the mask values for
   the Longs Peak example are contained in longs.152x458.mask.
   There are 458 rows and 152 values in each row.  The file
   extension "phase" indicates a file of phase values, "corr"
   indicates a file of correlation values for weighting, "mask"
   indicates a file that contains 0's where the phase should
   be masked out or ignored, and "surf" indicates a file that
   contains the elevation values for the actual (true) surface.
   
   For the actual data sets (ifsar, head and knee), only the
   phase data is available.  For the "artificial" data sets
   (shear, spiral and noise) only the phase data and the actual
   surface data used to generate the phase data are available.
   The simulated IFSAR data sets (longs and isola) include the
   phase data, mask data, correlation data and actual surface
   data.  
   
   All of the files consist of 1-byte values, except for the
   surface (surf) files, which consist of 4-byte floating-point
   values.  The 1-byte phase values denote the phase scaled and
   quantized to the range 0-255.  The 1-byte correlation and
   mask values denote the weights 0-1 scaled and quantized to
   the range 0-255.
   
   The simulated IFSAR data sets (longs and isola) were created
   by Dr. Michael Roth of the Johns Hopkins University Applied
   Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.  The MRI data sets
   (head and knee) are courtesy of Dr. Gang Zhu and come from
   the ESTEEM clinical MRI scanner manufactured by Elscint MR
   Inc., Ft. Collins, Colorado.  We thank them for allowing us
   to post these files at this ftp site.
   
   The following table lists the files, along with a short
   description and the book figure that shows the data.
